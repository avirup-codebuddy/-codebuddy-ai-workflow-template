# Debugging Routine

This routine is designed for tackling persistent errors or incomplete fixes when standard debugging approaches get stuck.

## Diagnosis

- Gather all error messages, logs, and behavioral symptoms.
- Add relevant context from files.
- Retrieve relevant project architecture, plan, and current working task.

## Observations and Reasoning

- Whenever a test fails, always add more context using the diagnosis steps above to effectively debug the issue before moving towards a fix.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS and then provide your REASONINGS to explain why this is EXACTLY the issue and not anything else.
- If unsure, get more OBSERVATIONS by adding more context to the issue so you know exactly and specifically what's wrong. You can also seek clarification if required.

## Analysis and Problem Solving

- Understand the relevant architecture.
- Use step-by-step reasoning to think of all possible causes, such as architectural misalignment or design flaws, rather than just simple bugs.
- Look for similar patterns already solved elsewhere in the codebase or use web search if needed.

## Applying Fixes

- Present your proposed fix for validation.
- Start modifying code to update and fix things using systematic code protocols and testing.
