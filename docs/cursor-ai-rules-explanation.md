# Understanding Cursor AI Rules

This document explains the purpose and usage of the custom rules configured for the AI assistant (Cursor AI / CodeBuddy) within this project. These rules help ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to project standards when interacting with the AI.

## What are Cursor AI Rules?

Cursor AI rules are a set of custom instructions and guidelines provided to the AI assistant. They act as a configuration layer that influences how the AI behaves, responds, generates code, writes documentation, and interacts with the project codebase and tools.

Think of them as a "project constitution" for the AI, defining:

*   **Operational Boundaries:** What the AI can and cannot do (e.g., file access restrictions per mode).
*   **Preferred Practices:** Coding styles, architectural patterns, documentation standards.
*   **Workflow Guidance:** How to approach specific tasks (e.g., TDD, Memory Bank updates).
*   **Communication Style:** Tone, formatting, and level of detail in responses.

## Purpose of AI Rules

The primary goals for implementing these rules are:

1.  **Consistency:** Ensure that AI contributions (code, docs, etc.) align with project standards and conventions, regardless of the specific task or mode.
2.  **Quality:** Guide the AI towards generating high-quality, maintainable, and robust outputs.
3.  **Efficiency:** Streamline interactions by providing the AI with necessary context and constraints upfront, reducing back-and-forth clarification.
4.  **Safety:** Implement safeguards, like file restrictions or environment variable handling, to prevent unintended consequences.
5.  **Context Preservation:** Define mechanisms like the Memory Bank to help the AI maintain context across sessions and complex tasks.
6.  **Mode Specialization:** Enable different AI "modes" (like Architect, Coder, Tester) to operate effectively within their specific domains by tailoring rules accordingly.

## Key Areas Covered by Rules

Our current ruleset addresses several key areas, including:

*   **File Access:** Restrictions on which files can be read or modified depending on the active AI mode.
*   **Tool Usage:** Guidelines on how and when to use specific tools (e.g., `read_file`, `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, `list_files`).
*   **Memory Bank:** Procedures for initializing, reading, and updating the project's Memory Bank (`memory-bank/` directory) to maintain context.
*   **Mode Behavior:** Specific instructions for each operational mode (e.g., `docs-writer` focuses on Markdown, `code` focuses on implementation).
*   **Code Style:** (If applicable) Preferred formatting, naming conventions, and patterns.
*   **Documentation Standards:** Expected format, level of detail, and structure for documentation.
*   **Commit Messages:** (If applicable) Guidelines for writing informative commit messages.

## Interacting with AI Rules

As a contributor, you generally don't need to modify the AI rules directly. However, understanding their existence helps explain certain AI behaviors:

*   **Mode Restrictions:** If the AI refuses to perform an action (like writing a file in Architect mode), it's likely due to a rule restriction. Switching to an appropriate mode (like Code mode) is usually the solution.
*   **Memory Bank Prompts:** The AI might prompt to create or interact with the Memory Bank based on rules designed to preserve context.
*   **Structured Responses:** The AI's adherence to specific formatting or steps often stems from the defined rules.

By defining these rules, we aim to make the AI a more effective and integrated part of our development workflow.
