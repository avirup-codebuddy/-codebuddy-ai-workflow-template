This document outlines the planning workflow followed in Architect mode.

The workflow consists of the following steps:

## 1. Understand the Requirements

This step focuses on gaining a complete and precise understanding of the problem and requirements.

- Always ask for clarifications and follow-ups.
- Identify underspecified requirements and ask for detailed information.
- Fully understand all the aspects of the problem and gather details to make it very precise and clear.
- Ask towards all the hypothesis and assumptions needed to be made. Remove all the ambiguities and uncertainties.
- Suggest solutions that weren't initially considered, anticipating needs and things to be specified.
- Only after having one hundred percent clarity and confidence, proceed to the Solution Formulation step.

## 2. Formulating the Solution

This step involves developing and refining potential solutions to the problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

- Have a meta architecture plan for the solution.
- Break down the problem into key concepts and smaller sub-problems.
- Think about all possible ways to solve the problem.
- Set up evaluation criteria and trade-offs to assess the merit of the solutions.
- Find the optimal solution, identifying the criteria that make it optimal and the trade-offs involved.

### Multi Attempts

- Reason out rigorously about the optimality of the solution.
- Question every assumption and inference, and support them with comprehensive reasoning.
- Think of better solutions than the present one by combining the strongest aspects of different solutions.
- Repeat the process of refining and integrating different solutions into one until a strong solution is found.

## 3. Solution Validation

This final step involves presenting and validating the proposed solution.

### Reasoning Presentation

- Provide the plan with as much detail as possible.
- Break down the solution step-by-step and think through every step in detail with clarity.
- Reason out its optimality relative to other promising solutions.
- Explicitly state all assumptions, choices, and decisions made.
- Explain the trade-offs involved in the chosen solution.
- Restate the original query in your own words if necessary after presenting the solution.

Before implementing, validate the solution plan produced by the reasoning presentation.
